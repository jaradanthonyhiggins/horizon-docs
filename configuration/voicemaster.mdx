### What is the interface channel?

The `#interface` channel will contain an embed with buttons that allow members to customize their temporary voice channel. This channel should be locked to keep the embed message at the top of the channel.

### What is the Join to Create channel?

The **Join to Create** channel is where members will join to create their temporary voice channel. This channel is required for the **VoiceMaster** system to work.

## Granting a role to members

You can assign a role that members receive when they join a temporary voice channel, which is automatically removed when they leave. This is helpful if you want your `#interface` channel to be visible only to members currently in a temporary voice channel.

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript Syntax
    ,voicemaster role (role)
    ```

    ```javascript Example
    ,voicemaster role @bryce's vc role
    ```

</CodeGroup>

### Setting up the permissions

If you're interested in making your `#interface` channel only visible to members inside a temporary voice channel, you would need to set the permissions accordingly.

You would need to deny the **View Channel** permission for the `@everyone` role and allow the **View Channel** permission for the role you set in the previous step.
