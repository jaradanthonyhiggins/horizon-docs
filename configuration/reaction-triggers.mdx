## Manually reacting to a message

You can use the `reaction` command to react to a message with bleed.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,reaction (message link) (emoji)
```

```javascript Example
,reaction .../channels/... üòç
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/reaction-triggers/react.gif" />
</Frame>

## Creating a reaction trigger

You can create a reaction trigger with the `reaction add` command.

<Warning>
  Common words such as `hey` are not allowed as triggers, as they cause heavy
  load on the bot.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,reaction add (emoji) (trigger)
```

```javascript Example
,reaction add üòç jon
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/reaction-triggers/add.png" />
</Frame>

### Viewing who added a reaction trigger

You can use the `reaction owner` command to view who added a reaction trigger.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,reaction owner (trigger)
```

```javascript Example
,reaction owner jon
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/reaction-triggers/owner.png" />
</Frame>

## Removing a reaction trigger

You can remove a reaction trigger with the `reaction remove` command.

<Info>If you're struggling to remove a reaction trigger, refer to the [selection removal](/resources/syntax#removing-entries-via-id).</Info>
<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,reaction remove (emoji) (trigger)
```

```javascript Example
,reaction remove üòç jon
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/reaction-triggers/remove.png" />
</Frame>

### Removing all reactions for a trigger

You can remove all reactions for a trigger with the `reaction removeall` command.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,reaction removeall (trigger)
```

```javascript Example
,reaction removeall jon
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/reaction-triggers/removeall.png" />
</Frame>

## Reacting to every message

If you're interested in having reactions on every message, you can use the `reaction messages` command.
This is useful for channels like `#selfies` where messages can be voted on.

<Warning>
  The channel must either be set as `imgonly` or have a slowmode of at least
  **one minute**.
</Warning>
<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,reaction messages (channel) (up to three emojis)
```

```javascript Example
,reaction messages #selfies üòç üòê ü§Æ
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/reaction-triggers/messages.png" />
</Frame>

### Removing all message reactions

You can use the `reaction messages` command without emojis to remove all reactions.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,reaction messages (channel)
```

```javascript Example
,reaction messages #selfies
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/reaction-triggers/messages-remove.png" />
</Frame>
