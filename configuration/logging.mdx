## Overview

Logging allows you to log events in your server. This can be useful for keeping track of what's happening in your server.

## Adding a logging event

You can add a logging event using the `log add` command.

<Info>
  Available logging events are `messages`, `members`, `roles`, `channels`,
  `invites`, `emojis` and `voice`.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Do not delete the webhook that bleed creates in your logging channels!
</Warning>

```

```javascript Example
,log add #logs messages
```
