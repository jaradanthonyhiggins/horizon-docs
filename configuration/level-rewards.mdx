## Getting started

Before you run any commands, it's important to use the `levels unlock` command otherwise
XP will not be tracked for users. You can also use the `levels lock` command to temporarily stop tracking XP.

## Ignoring channels and roles

You should immediately ignore channels and roles that you don't want gaining XP. You can do this by using the `levels ignore` command.

<Info>
  If you no longer want to ignore a channel or role, you can re-run the command.
  You can also use `levels list` to view all ignored channels and roles.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,levels ignore (channel or role)
```

```javascript Example
,levels ignore #spam
,levels ignore @jailed
```

</CodeGroup>

## Setting up roles to reward

You can reward your members with roles when they reach a certain level. You can use the `levels add` command to add a level reward.

<Info>
  If you no longer want to reward a role for a level, you can use the `level
  remove` command.
</Info>
<Tip>If your server already has XP, you can use the `levels sync` command to ensure that all users have the correct roles based on their XP.</Tip>
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,levels add (role) (level)
,levels remove (level)
```

```javascript Example
,levels add @Levelone 5
,levels remove 5
```

</CodeGroup>

### Stacking reward roles

Stacking roles means that users will keep all the roles they've earned when they reach a new level, instead of only having the role for their current level. By default, this feature is enabled.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,levels stackroles (on or off)
```

```javascript Example
,levels stackroles off
```

</CodeGroup>

## Customizing level-up messages

You can customize the level-up message that will be sent when a user achieves a new level.

<Info>
  The `message` parameter can be raw text or an [embed](/resources/scripting)
  with dynamic [variables](/resources/scripting/variables).
</Info>
<Warning>You must include the `{guild.name}` variable in your message otherwise it will not work.</Warning>
<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,levels message (text or embed code)
```

```javascript Example
,levels message Congrats {user} on reaching level {level.new_rank} in {guild.name}!
,levels message {embed}$v{message: {user.mention}}$v{description: you have reached level {level.new_rank} in {guild.name}}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Setting where the message is sent

You can set the channel where the level-up message will be sent. By default, the message is sent in the same channel where the user achieved the level.

The `option` parameter can be one of the following:

- `pm` - Sends the message in the user's direct messages.
- `context` - Sends the message in the same channel where the user gained XP.
- `#channel` - Sends the message in the specified channel.
- `none` - Entirely disables the level-up message.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,levels messagemode (option)
```

```javascript Example
,levels messagemode #level-up
,levels messagemode pm
```

</CodeGroup>

## Changing a member's level

You can change a member's level to a specific level or set their XP to a specific amount.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,setlevel (member) (level)
,setxp (member) (xp)
```

```javascript Example
,setlevel @user 5
,setxp @user 10000
```

</CodeGroup>

## Changing the XP multiplier

You can change the XP multiplier to increase or decrease the amount of XP members receive.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,levels setrate (multiplier)
```

```javascript Example
,levels setrate 2.4
```

</CodeGroup>
