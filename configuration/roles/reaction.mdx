## What are reaction roles?

Reaction roles are roles that are assigned to members when they react to a message. This can be useful for letting members choose unique roles or as a way to verify themselves.

## Creating a reaction role

You can create multiple reaction roles for a single message with a different emoji for each role.

<Info>
  You can find the message link by **right-clicking** or **holding down** on the
  message and selecting **Copy Message Link**.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,reactionrole add (message link) (emoji) (role)
```

```javascript Example
,reactionrole add .../channels/... ✅ @Member
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/roles/reaction/setting-role.gif" />
</Frame>

## Removing a reaction role

You can remove a reaction role by using the `reactionrole remove` command.

<Tip>
You can use the `reactionrole list` command to see all reaction roles and their emojis.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/roles/reaction/list.png" />
</Frame>
</Tip>
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,reactionrole remove (message link) (emoji)
```

```javascript Example
,reactionrole remove .../channels/... ✅
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/roles/reaction/remove.png" />
</Frame>

### Removing all reaction roles for a message

You can remove all reaction roles for a message with the `reactionrole removeall` command.

<Info>This is different from `reactionrole reset` which removes all reaction roles from the server.</Info>
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,reactionrole removeall (message link)
```

```javascript Example
,reactionrole removeall .../channels/...
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/roles/reaction/removeall.png" />
</Frame>

### Removing all reaction roles from the server

You can remove all reaction roles from the server by using the `reactionrole reset` command.

<Warning>
  This **CAN NOT** be undone and will remove **ALL** reaction roles from the
  server.
</Warning>
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/configuration/roles/reaction/reset.png" />
</Frame>

## Setting up a verification system

Reaction roles can be used to create a verification system where members must react to a message to gain access to the server.

<Info>
  In order for this to work, you'll need to create a role that will be assigned
  to members when they react to the message, such as a **Member** role.
