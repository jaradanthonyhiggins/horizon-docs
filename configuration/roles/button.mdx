## What are button roles?

Button roles are roles that are assigned to members when they click a button on an existing message or embed. They can be useful for letting members choose unique roles or as a way to verify themselves.

## Creating a button role

You can create multiple button roles for a single message.

<Warning>
  Button roles can only be placed on messages & embeds sent by bleed. Learn how to create an embed [**here**](/resources/scripting/embeds)!
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,buttonrole add (message link) (role) (style) (emoji) (label)

// Available styles: "green," "blurple," "gray," or "red."
```

```javascript Example
,buttonrole add .../channels/... Verified green âœ… Verify
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/roles/button/add.gif" />
</Frame>

## Removing a button role

You can remove a specific button role by using the `buttonrole remove` command.

<Tip>
You can use the `buttonrole list` command to see all button roles in your server.
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/roles/button/list.png" />
</Frame>
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,buttonrole remove (message link) (button number)
```

```javascript Example
,buttonrole remove .../channels/... 1
```
</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/roles/button/remove.png" />
</Frame>

### Removing all button roles for a message

Additionally, you can remove all button roles from a message by using the `buttonrole removeall` command.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,buttonrole removeall (message link)
```

```javascript Example
,buttonrole removeall .../channels/...
```
</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/configuration/roles/button/removeall.png" />
</Frame>

### Removing all button roles from the server

You can remove all button roles from the server by using the `buttonrole reset` command.

<Warning>
  Please note that this **cannot** be undone & will **permanently** remove **all** button roles from the
  server.
</Warning>

```
,buttonrole reset
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/configuration/roles/button/reset.png" />
