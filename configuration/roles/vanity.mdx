## Getting started

This feature uses a dedicated bot due to some limitations with the main bleed bot. You can invite the dedicated bot by clicking [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=996638412675227668&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

<Warning>
  Your server must be **Level 3** with at least **14 boosts** prior to inviting
  the dedicated bot.
</Warning>
<Info>
  All commands are **slash commands** and can be accessed by typing `/vanity` in
  a text channel.
</Info>

## Setting the vanity to be monitored

You'll need to set what vanity you want to monitor. You can do this by using the `/vanity set` command.

<Tip>It's recommended to prefix the substring with a `/` (e.g. `/bleed`).</Tip>
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
/vanity set (substring)
```

```javascript Example
/vanity set /bleed
```

</CodeGroup>

## Setting up roles to reward

You can use the `/vanity role add` command to add a vanity reward.

  If you no longer want to reward a role for a vanity, you can use the `/vanity
  role remove` command.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
/vanity role add (role)
/vanity role remove (role)
```

```javascript Example
/vanity role add @Vanity

## Setting up the award message

You can set a thank you message for when a user advertises your server in their status.

<Info>
  The `message` parameter can be raw text or an [embed](/resources/scripting)
  with dynamic [variables](/resources/scripting/variables).
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
/vanity message (message)
```

```javascript Example
/vanity message thank you {user.mention}
/vanity message {embed}$v{message: {user.mention}}$v{description: thank you for advertising our server!}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Setting where the message is sent

You can use the `/vanity award channel` command to set where the message is sent.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
/vanity award channel (channel)
```

```javascript Example
/vanity award channel #general
```

</CodeGroup>
