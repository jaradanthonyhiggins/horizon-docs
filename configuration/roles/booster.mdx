## What are booster roles?

Booster roles are unique roles that are given to members which have boosted your server. These roles can be fully customized by the members themselves.

## Setting the base role

In order for the booster roles to work, you must set a base role. All booster roles will be placed under this role.

<Tip>The base role should be a role which is above any roles with a color, otherwise the color won't be visible due to Discord's role hierarchy.</Tip>
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,boosterrole base (role)
```

```javascript Example
,boosterrole base @------
```

</CodeGroup>

## Creating a booster role

You can create a booster role by using the `boosterrole` command itself.

<Info>The `color` parameter can be a hex code or a color name.</Info>

<CodeGroup>

,boosterrole #3498DB boss
```
