```javascript Syntax
,settings dj (role)
```

```javascript Example
,settings dj @DJ
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>

</Frame>

## Queueing Music

You can queue music with the `play` command.

<Tip>
  By default, the `play` command will search **Deezer**. You're able to provide
  a **URL** which will queue the music directly from the source you provide.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,play (query or URL)
```

```javascript Example
,play jeans 2hollis
,play https://open.spotify.com/track/6C2nVSSeXNqfoY8t6tliZ4
```

## Managing the Queue

### Viewing the tracks in the queue

Use the `queue` command to view the tracks in the queue.
Each track has a corresponding position which can be used to interact with the queue.

### Removing a track from the queue

Use the `queue remove` command to remove a track from the queue.
You must provide the [track position](#viewing-the-tracks-in-the-queue) which can be found with the `queue` command.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,queue remove (position)
```

```javascript Example
,queue remove 2
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/miscellaneous/music/queue-remove.png" />
</Frame>

### Moving a track in the queue

Use the `queue move` command to move a track in the queue.
You must provide the [current position](#viewing-the-tracks-in-the-queue) and the new position.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,queue move (position) (new_position)
```

```javascript Example
,queue move 3 1
```
