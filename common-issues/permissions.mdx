## Text Channel Permissions

Usually, if members are still able to send messages in a text channel after being muted, it is likely because of the `@everyone` channel permissions being set incorrectly.
<Steps>
    <Step title="Set the channel permissions">
        Go to your channel settings, and navigate to the **Permissions** tab.
        Find the `@everyone` or **member** role and ensure that the **Send Messages** permission is set to **Neutral** (`/`).
        <Frame>
        <img
            src="/images/common-issues/channel-permission.png"
            className="w-auto"
        />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Check server wide role permissions">
        Go to your server settings, and navigate to the **Roles** tab.
        Find the `@everyone` or **member** role and ensure that the **Send Messages** permission isn't enabled.
        <Frame>
        <img
            src="/images/common-issues/server-role-permission.png"
            className="w-auto"
        />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Check for role overrides">
        Check if there are any roles that have permission overrides for the channel in question. If a role has the **Send Messages** permission enabled, it will override the `@everyone` permissions and allow members to send messages.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Lockdown Command

If you have a custom member role instead of the default `@everyone` role, make sure that the lockdown command is set to restrict that role instead of the `@everyone` role.
<Tip>The steps above are also required for the lockdown command to work properly.</Tip>

## Voice Channel Permissions

If your VoiceMaster channels aren't working as expected due to permission issues, you can use the **category** to manage permissions for all channels within it.
