## How It Works

<Info>
When you run `.location <location>`, Horizon:

1. Checks your search term and finds songss recorded at that location only.
2. Checks all sheets in the **Discography Tracker** (Released, Unreleased, Unsurfaced, Misc).
3. Returns a **detailed embed** with metadata including:
    - Era & Era Thumbnail
    - Producer & Engineer
    - Instrumental Names
    - File Names
    - **Recording Locations**
    - Recording, Preview, & Release Dates
    - Track Properties (Duration, Category)
    - Additional Info
4. Includes a **button linking to the Discography Tracker** for quick reference.

## Handling Errors

<Warning title="Command Limitations and Errors">
Horizon provides error embeds in the following cases:

- **Missing Location Name:**  
  `Please specify a location to search for.`

- **No Location Found:**  
  `No recording locations matching "<search term>" found.`
</Warning>

- Results may show multiple matchesâ€”**select the correct location** from the dropdown if prompted.
- Use the **Discography Tracker button** to explore Darthh's juice tracker (ðŸ’–).
