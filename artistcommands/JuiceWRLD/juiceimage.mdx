## What Is The JuiceImage Command?

The **.juiceimage** command allows you to **send random Juice WRLD images** from Horizonâ€™s image library.  
You can specify the number of images to send (up to 15 at once).  
Horizon automatically calculates the **brightest color** in each image to style the embed color dynamically.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Ensure Permissions">
        <Info>
            Make sure **Horizon, the channel, or the role** has the permissions **"Send Messages"**, **"Attach Files"**, and **"Embed Links"** in the channel where you want to run the command.
        </Info>
    </Step>

## How It Works

<Info>
When you run `.juiceimage` followed by an optional number, Horizon randomly selects JPG images from the **JUICE_IMAGE_FOLDER**.  
It sends each image as a separate embed with a dynamic color based on the image's **brightest pixel**.

## Handling Errors

<Warning title="Command Limitations and Errors">
Horizon provides error embeds in the following cases:

**Cooldown:** If you use the command too quickly (default 10s cooldown), you'll see:  
- `Please wait X seconds before using this command again.`

---

**Invalid Amount:** If the requested number is less than 1 or exceeds 15:  
- `Please request at least 1 image.`

- `You can request a maximum of 15 images at once.`
</Warning>

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- Requesting multiple images will send each as a separate embed.  
- The **embed color** is dynamically determined from the brightest pixel in the image.  
- Observe the **10-second cooldown** per user to prevent spam.
