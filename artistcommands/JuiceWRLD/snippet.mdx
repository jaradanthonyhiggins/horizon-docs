## What Is The .snippet Command?

The `.snippet` command lets you **search for snippets of ANY Juice WRLD song** and sends all snippets for that song.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Ensure Permissions">
        <Info>
            Make sure **Horizon, the channel, or the role** has the permissions **"Send Messages"** and **"View Channel"** in the channel where you want to run the command.
        </Info>

</Steps>

## How It Works

<Info>
Input any **full or partial song title** to fetch matching snippets.  
If multiple matching song titles are found, a **dropdown menu** allows you to select the correct song title.
All snippets are sent in batches (max 10 files per batch, 100MB limit per file).

```javascript Syntax

```

```javascript Example
.snippet Never Switch
```

## Handling No Matches

<Warning title="No Snippets Found">
If no snippets are found for the song title you entered, Horizon will respond with:  
`No snippets matching '<songname>' found!`
</Warning>

---

## Displayed Information

When snippets for a song title is found, Horizon will:

- Display a **success embed** with the song title(s) and the number of snippets found  
- Send **all snippet files** in batches of up to 10 per message
- Automatically delete sent snippet messages after **1 minute**  

<Info title="Example Embed">

> ### **âœ… Snippet(s) Found!**  
> - Found **10** Snippet(s) For **Never Switch**  
</Info>

## Navigation & Selection

If multiple song title's match:

- Horizon shows a **dropdown menu** with all matching song title(s)  
- Select the correct song title to display snippets  
- Only the original requester can interact with the dropdown  
- Selection times out after **60 seconds**

<Info>
Dropdown interaction ensures only the command author can select a snippet folder.
