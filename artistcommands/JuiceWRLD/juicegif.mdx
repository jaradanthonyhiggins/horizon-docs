## What Is The JuiceGIF Command?

The **.juicegif** command allows you to **get random Juice WRLD GIFs** from Horizon’s GIF library.  
You can specify how many GIFs to send by adding a number after the command (1–20).  
Horizon will provide an **error message** if the number is invalid or if no GIFs are available.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Ensure Permissions">
        <Info>
            Make sure **Horizon, the channel, or the role** has the permissions **"Send Messages"** and **"Attach Files"** in the channel where you want to run the command.
        </Info>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

<Info>
When you run `.juicegif` followed by an optional number, Horizon randomly selects GIFs from the **GIF folder** and sends them in the channel.  
You can request multiple GIFs at once (up to 20), and each will be sent as a separate message.

## Handling Errors

<Warning title="Invalid Number or Empty Folder">
If you provide a number outside the range 1–20, or if no GIFs are found, Horizon will respond with an error embed:  
`Please enter a valid number of GIFs to send (1-20).`  
</Warning>

## Tips & Best Practices
- Sending multiple GIFs in quick succession may take a few seconds depending on the number requested.  
- Horizon selects GIFs **randomly** each time, so repeated commands can yield sometimes the same results or entirely **different** results.
