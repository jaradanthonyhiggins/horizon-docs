## What Are The Surface Setup Commands?

These commands let you **configure automatic surface posting**:

1. `.setsurfacechannel` – Sets the channel where surface messages will be reposted.  
2. `.setsurfacerole` – Sets a role that will be pinged whenever a surface get's posted.  
3. `.removesurfacesetup` – Removes all surface configuration for the server.
