## What Is The JuiceInfo Command?

The **.juiceinfo** (or `.songinfo`) command allows you to **search for any Juice WRLD track** and receive a **fully formatted Discord embed** with all known metadata.  
This includes **track titles, alternate titles, credited artists, producers, engineers, instrumental info, file names, recording locations, dates, and era**.

## How It Works

<Info>
When you run `.juiceinfo <track name>`, Horizon:

1. Normalizes your search term to match track names and alternate titles.
2. Checks all sheets in the **Discography Tracker** (Released, Unreleased, Unsurfaced, Misc).
3. Returns a **detailed embed** with metadata including:
    - Era & Era Thumbnail
    - Producer & Engineer
    - Instrumental Names
    - File Names
    - Recording Locations
    - Recording, Preview, & Release Dates
    - Track Properties (Duration, Category)
    - Additional Info
4. Includes a **button linking to the Discography Tracker** for quick reference.

## Handling Multiple Matches

<Info>
If multiple tracks match your search term, Horizon displays a **dropdown menu** for you to choose the correct track.  
The dropdown shows:
- Track title (up to 100 characters)
- Era and song title(s) for context
</Info>

## Handling Errors

<Warning title="Command Limitations and Errors">
Horizon provides error embeds in the following cases:

- **Missing Track Name:**  
  `Please provide a track name to search for information.`

- **No Tracks Found:**  
  `No Tracks Matching "<search term>" Found!`
</Warning>

## Tips & Best Practices

- Search using **full or partial track titles**; alternate titles are also supported.
- Results may show multiple matchesâ€”**always select the correct track** from the dropdown if prompted.
- The **embed color and thumbnail** correspond to the trackâ€™s era for visual consistency.
- Use the **Discography Tracker button** to explore Darthh's juice tracker (ðŸ’–).
