## What Is The Groupbuy Command?

The **.groupbuy / .gb** command allows you to **search for Juice WRLD group buys** with ease.  
It shows important details like the **price, start date, and end date** of each group buy.  
If more than one result matches your search, Horizon will present a **dropdown menu** so you can quickly select the correct group buy.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Ensure Permissions">
        <Info>
            Make sure **Horizon, the channel, or the role** has the permissions **"Send Messages"** and **"View Channel"** in the channel where you want to run the command.

## How It Works

<Info>
When you run `.gb` or `.groupbuy` with a search term, Horizon checks for matches.  
It then builds an embed with all available group-buy information.

## Multiple Matches

When more than one result is found:

- Horizon sends an embed listing multiple matches.  
- A **dropdown menu** appears where you can select the correct group buy.  
- Upon selection, Horizon replaces the message with the **full embed + tracker link button**.
