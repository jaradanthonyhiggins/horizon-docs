## What Is The Era Command?

The era command lets you view **Juice WRLD eras, sessions, and album reissues** with their **start / end dates**, **release / reissue dates**, **track counts**, and **official covers**.  
It supports both **full names** and **abbreviations** (like `DRFL`, `GB&GR`, `TPNE`, etc.).

```javascript Example
Horizon: Multiple Matching Eras Found:
[Select an era...]
> Death Race For Love
> Death Race For Love (Sessions)

```
</CodeGroup>

- **Era Title** (with official cover as thumbnail)

Double-check your spelling or try with / without an abbreviation.
