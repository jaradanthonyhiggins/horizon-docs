## What Is The AutoGB Command?

The `.autogb` command allows you to **automatically create a live-updating Groupbuy embed** based on the live progress of that specific currently on-going groupbuy.

After selecting a Groupbuy, Horizon will:

- **Creates an embed with the current amount paid**, **the song(s) price**, **the amount of money left until the groupbuy is finished**, **the last donator's username**, **and the completion percent until the groupbuy is finished.**
- Adds a **Contribute Button**
- **Update the embed automatically** every minute
- Keep updating until the Groupbuy is completed or cancelled.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Ensure Admin Permissions">
        <Info>
            To use `.autogb`, you **must** have the **Administrator** permission.  
            Users without Admin will get a permission error embed.
        </Info>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Verify Premium Access">
        <Info>
            This command requires **Server Premium** or **User Premium**.          
            If your server is not premium, Horizon will show the premium prompt.
