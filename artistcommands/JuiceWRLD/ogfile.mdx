## What Is The .ogfile Command?

The **.ogfile** command allows you to **search Juice WRLD original file(s) straight from the studio with the highest sounding quality & original metadata.** and receive a **Discord embed with metadata** plus all available OG file uploads.  
It also supports **era detection**, **dropdown selection for multiple matches**, and **automatic cleanup** of messages after a set time.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Ensure Permissions">
        <Info>
            Make sure **Horizon, the channel, or the role** has permissions to **Send Messages**, **Embed Links**, and **Use External URLs** to fully display track information and the sheet button.
        </Info>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

When you run `.ogfile <track name>`, Horizon:

1. Normalizes your search term to match song name(s).  
2. If multiple matches are found:
   - A **dropdown menu** is displayed to select the correct folder.  
3. Once a song is chosen, Horizon:
   - Retrieves all files inside (up to 100MB per file).  
   - Sends them to the channel along with a metadata embed including:  
     - Song Title(s)  
     - Era & Era Thumbnail  
     - Embed Color matching the Era  
   - Starts a **timer** to delete the messages after 5 minutes, sending a success embed once deleted.

## Handling No Matches

If no folder matches your search, Horizon responds with:  
`No songs matching "<search term>" found!`

---

## Handling Multiple Matches

When multiple folders match:

- Horizon lists all matching song titles.  
- You select the correct one via a **dropdown menu**.  
- After selection, Horizon sends the metadata embed and all the files for the chosen song.

## File Size Limits

<Warning title="File Size Exceeded">
Please Note That Files Over 100MB Will **NOT** be able to be uploaded.
This Is Due To Discord's 100MB File Size Limit.
</Warning>

---

## Automatic Cleanup

- All embeds and sent files are **automatically deleted after 5 minutes**.  
<Tip>Horizon then sends a success embed confirming deletion:  
`Deleted all <NAME> OG file info!`</Tip>

## Tips & Best Practices

<Tip>
- Use **full or partial track names** when searching.  
- Choose the correct folder when the dropdown appears.  
Remember: **files are temporary** â€” they auto-delete after 5 minutes.  
- Embed color and thumbnail correspond to the **era** of the track.  
- Use `.ogfile` only when you need access to the **original working files** for a song.
