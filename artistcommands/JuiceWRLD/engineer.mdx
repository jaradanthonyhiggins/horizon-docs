## What Is The Engineer Command?

The engineer command lets you **search for tracks by that engineer**.  
It will return all matching tracks across **Released, Unreleased, Unsurfaced, and Misc** sheets in a **paginated embed** with navigation buttons.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Ensure Permissions">
        <Info>
            Make sure **Horizon, the channel, or the role** has the permissions **"Send Messages"** and **"View Channel"** in the channel where you want to run the command.
        </Info>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

<Info>
Input an **engineer name** to fetch all tracks associated with them.  
If multiple matches are found, Horizon will return a **paginated embed** with navigation buttons to scroll through results.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
.engineer (engineer name)
```

```javascript Example

```
</CodeGroup>

## Handling No Matches

<Warning title="No Tracks Found">
If no tracks are found for the engineer you searched, Horizon will respond with:  
`No tracks engineered by 'Engineer Name' found!`
</Warning>

## Navigation & Pagination

When multiple tracks match, Horizon shows **1 track per page** with navigation buttons:

- ⬅️ **Previous Page**  
- ➡️ **Next Page**  

<Info>
Pagination is limited to **60 seconds** of interaction. If inactive for more than **60 seconds**, the buttons will be disabled.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Always type the **Engineer’s full name** for best results (case-insensitive).  
- Supports Engineer's credited with **multiple tracks** across sheets.  
- Engineer names are normalized so variations like `Max Lord`, `max lord`, or `MAX LORD` all match.
