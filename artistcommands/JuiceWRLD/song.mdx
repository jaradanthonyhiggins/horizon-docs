## What Is The .song Command?

The `.session` command lets you **search for ANY Juice WRLD song to exist** and sends a detailed embed showing **song title, era, cover art, and the hyperlink to the song's download.**.  
If multiple songs match the search term, a **dropdown menu** will let you choose the correct song.
