## What Are The Snippet Setup Commands?

These commands let you **configure automatic snippet posting**:

1. `.setsnippetchannel` – Sets the channel where snippet messages will be reposted.  
2. `.setsnippetrole` – Sets a role that will be pinged whenever a snippet posts.  
3. `.removesnippetsetup` – Removes all snippet configuration for the server.
