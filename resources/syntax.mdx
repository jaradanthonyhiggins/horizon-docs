## Formatting a duration

When a command requires a `duration` parameter, you format it as a number followed by a unit. The unit can be one of the following:

- `s` for seconds.
- `m` for minutes.
- `h` for hours.
- `d` for days.
- `w` for weeks.

For example, `1d` represents one day, and `1w` represents one week. You can also combine units, for example, `1w2d` represents one week and two days.

<CodeGroup>

    ```javascript Correct
    ,timeout @member 1h
    ,timeout @member 2d3h
    ```
    ```javascript Incorrect
    ,timeout @member 1 hour
    ,timeout @member 2 days 3 hours
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Removing entries via ID

For some commands, you can remove entries by their ID. The ID for entry can be found with the `list` subcommand.
After you have the ID, you can remove the entry with the `remove` subcommand followed by the format: `select:ID`.

## Flag Punishments

When a command has a `--do` flag, you can use it to specify the action to take. The available actions are:

- `warn` to warn the user.
- `jail` to jail the user.
- `kick` to kick the member from the server.
- `ban` to ban the member from the server.
- `delete` to delete the message if applicable.
- `stripstaff` to remove the staff role from the member.
  - This is only available for **antinuke** commands.
  - This will only work for roles set via the `bind staff` command.
  - You can find more information about binding staff roles in the [moderation](/security/moderation#setting-staff-roles) section.

For example, to warn a user, you would use `--do warn`.

<Tip>
  If bleed is responding with a different action than the one you specified,
  make sure you're using the correct `--` instead of `â€”`. Learn more about the
  difference [here](/common-issues/ios-dash).
